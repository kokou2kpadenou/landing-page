## Summary

The objective of this project is to provide you with practical examples of how to manipulate the DOM. The functionalities used in this project serve two purposes: to help you learn how to add dynamically generated data to the DOM and to demonstrate how JavaScript can enhance the user experience of a static website. Although this project only scratches the surface of what is possible, it utilizes some very common events, methods, and logic.

During the development of this project, aim to refactor and test your code as much as possible. For every feature you add, expect to spend an equal amount of time testing and refining your code. If it takes you three hours to figure out the logic, it should take you another three hours to ensure that you have written the best possible code. As you improve your skills, this process will become more natural. Remember to remove any debugging code before submitting your final work.

## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

## Project description

"Exploring the Great Outdoors" is a project that aims to inspire and guide outdoor enthusiasts to explore and experience the natural world. The project is centered around a website that provides information, resources, and inspiration for anyone interested in hiking, camping, wildlife watching, and other outdoor activities.

The website is divided into four main sections: Hiking, Camping, Wildlife, and Gear. Each section features articles, guides, and photos that offer practical tips, advice, and inspiration for anyone interested in that particular aspect of outdoor exploration. For example, the Hiking section might include guides to popular hiking trails, safety tips, and advice on gear and equipment, while the Wildlife section might feature articles on birdwatching, animal tracking, and conservation efforts.

The goal of the project is to encourage people to get outside and explore the natural world, whether they are seasoned outdoor enthusiasts or just starting to dip their toes into the world of outdoor adventure. By providing high-quality, informative content that is both engaging and accessible, "Exploring the Great Outdoors" hopes to inspire people to appreciate the beauty of nature and to become more active and engaged members of their local outdoor communities.
